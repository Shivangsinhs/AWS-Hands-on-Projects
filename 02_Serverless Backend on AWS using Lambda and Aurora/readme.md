# Serverless Backend on AWS using Lambda and Aurora

This repository provides an example implementation of a serverless backend using AWS Lambda and Amazon Aurora. It demonstrates how to build a scalable and cost-effective backend architecture that can handle various types of applications.

## Overview

The serverless backend architecture consists of the following components:

1. **AWS Lambda**: Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. In this architecture, Lambda functions handle the business logic and respond to incoming requests.

2. **Amazon Aurora**: Aurora is a fully managed relational database service provided by AWS. It offers the performance and availability of traditional enterprise databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. Aurora serves as the backend data storage for the application.

3. **API Gateway**: API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create, publish, and manage APIs at any scale. It acts as the entry point for incoming requests and triggers the appropriate Lambda function.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create Lambda functions, Aurora database, and API Gateway resources.
- The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured on your local machine.
- Basic knowledge of AWS Lambda, Amazon Aurora, and API Gateway concepts.

## Setup

Step 1: Open console and create Database. CHoose Standard create and select engine type as Amazon Auora.Select Production Templates and then set memorable password into Credentials setting. Put intial database name as "Serverless". Now select Create database.

Step2:Now to test the database, Click on saved Database. We will create the table by clicking on Query editor on right.

## Disclaimer

This repository provides an example implementation and should not be considered production-ready without proper review and testing. Ensure to follow AWS best practices and security guidelines when deploying your serverless backend in a production environment.

Please note that the AWS services used in this architecture may incur costs. Review the pricing details on the AWS website to understand the potential charges associated with running this serverless backend.
