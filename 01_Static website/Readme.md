Deploy a Static Website on AWS

The cloud is perfect to host both static as well as Dynamic website.Static website deployment in AWS allows us to easily and securely host the website in the cloud. Unlike dynamic websites, which rely on server-side scripting languages and databases, static websites consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to users. This makes them simpler and faster to deploy, as well as more secure, since they don't require the same level of server-side processing and are less vulnerable to common web application attacks.
